## The project is not finished.

This is project "Gallery of Memes". You can see random meme or list all of them. The project is unfinished, but you will be able to add memes to favourites, look over it in section ‘Favourites’ and send them on your e-mail. I’m going to do logging using Local Storage. 

# How to start

First, you have to download the repository from github by click on **clone** button and then paste it after `git clone` command in your terminal in place you like to have it.
You should also install **node.js** to use *node-sass* extension. 
Use the following commands in your terminal:
`npm init -y` - for create the package.json file
`npm install node-sass` - for installing the extension

# Scripts

`npm run sass` - runs node-sass extension on index.html and register.html which are login and register sites
`npm run sass2` - runs node-sass extension on homepage.html, demo.html, random.html and favourite.html
